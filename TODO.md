1. All exception message must be detailed and unique as no number is there now.
2. LuceneIndexer, test with testIssue174()
3. Ensure every error event in replication
4. Tombstone Garbage Collection

    note left of Server: Validates Auth token in message
    
    note over Replica (R1)
        Somehow need to bar Replica from 
        sending DataGateFeed message to
        Server before receiving ConnectAck
    end note
    
    alt Valid token
        Server->Server: Stores replica id
        Server->Replica (R1): ConnectAck Message
        note left of Replica (R1):
            Replica can now receive DataGateFeed
        end note

    Replica (R1)->Server: BatchChangeStart Message
    note right of Replica (R1)
        In replica keep the list of NitriteIds of
        the Documents sending to servers. Server
        would send back BatchChangeAck message with
        list of NitriteIds accepted by Server. Replica
        will remove those ids from it's list. Finally
        after exchange is completed this list size should
        be 0.
    end note

        If changes exists sends changes 
        in chunks, size is sets in replication
